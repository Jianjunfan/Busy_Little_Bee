 How to setup Kdiff3 with git as mergetool
1. Install
- Download kdiff3 OS X package from their website(sourceforge)
- Install the app in application folder

2. Config .gitconfig file to add kdiff3 as merge tool
Fire up ~/.gitconfig in your favorite editor and put the following there. (This also put KDiff as diff tool)

[difftool "kdiff3"]
    path = /Applications/kdiff3.app/Contents/MacOS/kdiff3
    trustExitCode = false
[difftool]
    prompt = false
[diff]
    tool = kdiff3
[mergetool "kdiff3"]
    path = /Applications/kdiff3.app/Contents/MacOS/kdiff3
    trustExitCode = false
[mergetool]
    keepBackup = false
[merge]
    tool = kdiff3
    
3. Run git command to do merge and resolve conflict
$ git config merge.tool kdiff3
   # set kdiff3 tool as merge tool
$ git merge dev
   # Merge from dev branch to current branch
$ git mergetool
   # if have conflict, will launch kdiff3 UI and ready to resolve conflict
   
Note: Close kdiff3 will automatically start kdiff3 tool if have more conflicted files


Another useful Git Command:
git merge --strategy-option theirs remote-branch-name

#Above command will totally use remote branch code(theirs) (need not manually merge conflits)
ours
    This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved cleanly by 
    favoring our version. Changes from the other tree that do not 
    conflict with our side are reflected to the merge result.

    This should not be confused with the ours merge strategy, which does 
    not even look at what the other tree contains at all. It discards 
    everything the other tree did, declaring our history contains all that
    happened in it.

theirs
    This is opposite of ours.
