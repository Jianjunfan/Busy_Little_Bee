 How to setup Kdiff3 with git as mergetool
1. Install
- Download kdiff3 OS X package from their website(sourceforge)
- Install the app in application folder

2. Config .gitconfig file to add kdiff3 as merge tool
Fire up ~/.gitconfig in your favorite editor and put the following there. (This also put KDiff as diff tool)

[difftool "kdiff3"]
    path = /Applications/kdiff3.app/Contents/MacOS/kdiff3
    trustExitCode = false
[difftool]
    prompt = false
[diff]
    tool = kdiff3
[mergetool "kdiff3"]
    path = /Applications/kdiff3.app/Contents/MacOS/kdiff3
    trustExitCode = false
[mergetool]
    keepBackup = false
[merge]
    tool = kdiff3
    
3. Run git command to do merge and resolve conflict
$ git config merge.tool kdiff3
   # set kdiff3 tool as merge tool
$ git merge dev
   # Merge from dev branch to current branch
$ git mergetool
   # if have conflict, will launch kdiff3 UI and ready to resolve conflict
   
Note: Close kdiff3 will automatically start kdiff3 tool if have more conflicted files
